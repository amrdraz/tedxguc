TED Talks began as a simple attempt to share what happens at TED 
with the world. Under the moniker "ideas worth spreading," talks 
were released online. They rapidly attracted a global audience in the 
millions. Indeed, the reaction was so enthusiastic that the entire 
TED website has been reengineered around TED Talks, with the 
goal of giving everyone on-demand access to the world's most 
inspiring voices. As of November 2012, TED Talks have been viewed 
more than one billion times.

	<span>Our mission</span> 
	<br/>
	Spreading ideas.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, 
lives and ultimately, the world. So we're building here a 
clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the 
world's most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious 
souls to engage with ideas and each other. The TED site, launched 
April 2007, is an ever-evolving work in progress, and you're an 
important part of it. Have an idea? We want to hear from you.

TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive, in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.

TEDâ€™s media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.
